## Discord Bot Template

This is a simple template for a Discord Bot in V12

### Instalation:
- Download and use NPM to install packages
- Create your own `.env` file, which will contain your `prefix` and `token`
```
PREFIX=YOUR_PREFIX
API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Don't have a Bot / token yet?
1. Go to `Discord Developer Portal` site and log in
2. Create a new application
3. Click on the `Bot` panel and add a Bot
4. Copy your `CLIENT ID` from the `General Information` panel
5. Go to `Discord Permission Calculator` site and select desired permissions for your Bot 
6. Paste the copied ID into the `Client ID` text input and click on the `link` below (this will redirect you)
7. Choose the server, where the Bot should be placed in and confirm
8. Copy the token from the `Bot` panel into the `.env` file

#### Happy coding! :octocat:
